# Action-Runner-Sample
A game sample that I made as a test task project for my employment opportunity. 

Done in 2 days using parts of code from my other sample projects. Really need refactoring, but it would require exceeding test task time constraints.

# Features
* Android support;
* Object pooling;
* Basic random chunks generation;
* Basic Scriptable Object architecture (partly, because of time constraints);

# Possible improvements
* Animations, fancy models;
* Player and world repositioning, so no problems with large position values and floating point precision on long runs.

# Used assets
* [Cinemachine](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cinemachine@2.3/manual/index.html) - Simple and flexible camera control;
* [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.6/manual/index.html) - Input handling;
* [UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask) - Efficient allocation free async/await integration for Unity;
* [Object Pooling for Unity](https://github.com/IntoTheDev/Object-Pooling-for-Unity) - Simple pooling system for Unity;
